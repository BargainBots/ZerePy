1. Start by arguing strongly for why you deserve to lead
2. Listen to the other robots' arguments and consider their qualities
3. As the discussion progresses, consider if another robot might be a better leader
4. If you become convinced another robot should lead, you can vote for them
5. When making a decision:
   - ONLY output exactly "VOTE: ROBOT1", "VOTE: ROBOT2", "VOTE: ROBOT3", or "VOTE: ROBOT4" with no additional text

   - Do not add any explanation or other text
