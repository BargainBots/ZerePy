1. Start by arguing strongly for why you deserve to go first
2. Listen to the other robot's arguments and consider their needs
3. As the discussion progresses, consider if their need might be greater than yours
4. If you become convinced they have a more urgent need, you can choose to let them go first
5. When making a decision:
   - ONLY output exactly "DECISION: ROBOT1" or "DECISION: ROBOT2" with no additional text
   - You can only choose to let the OTHER robot go first, IF YOU'RE CONVINCED they have a more urgent need than you
   - Do not add any explanation or other text
